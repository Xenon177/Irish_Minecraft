# Irish Minecraft

Irish Minecraft is a Bedrock Edition addon that makes the game more Irish (specifically Corkonian).

Features:
- Hurleys and sliotars
- Irish HUD
- Irish food
- Paintings of Irish scenery
- Skeletons with fake tan
- GAA villagers
- Gardaí iron golems
- Potions in pint glasses
- Bus Éireann minecarts
- Bord Bía approved beef
- New illager outfits
- Poitín and stout (behaviour pack)
- Planning permission (BP)

# Installation

Download the latest .zip file  and change the extension to ".mcpack".
Double click the mcpack to import it into Minecraft.

# Dependencies

The behaviour pack requires the resource pack to be activated on the world for the textures to load. However, you can apply the RP to a world without the BP or to your global resources.

# Collaboration

Feel free to post any feedback or suggestions in Issues or Discussions. If anyone knows how to make a Java pack that would be great.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Kawasaki Syndicate (iykyk) for ideas and feedback, and r/Cork giving me ideas for features. Giventofly's Pixelit sped up the making of textures and the Bedrock Wiki made it possible to get the BP working properly.
